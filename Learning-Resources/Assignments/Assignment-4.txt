Our fourth assignment is a proof of stake implementation with the same networking concepts as the last tutorial:
https://medium.com/@mycoralhealth/part-2-networking-code-your-own-blockchain-in-less-than-200-lines-of-go-17fe1dad46e1

Again, in this tutorial, our goal should be to serve the same blockchain with processes on different ports.

This logic is not built into the tutorial and could prove to be difficult.  However, once we achieve this step,
it is not much extra work to deploy our own blockchain to the cloud.
