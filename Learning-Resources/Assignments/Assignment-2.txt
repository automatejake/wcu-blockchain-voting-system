Our second assigment is focussed on understanding different validation mechanisms.  

We will follow the same series of articles to code simple PoW and PoS chains (still single node):

PoW: https://medium.com/@mycoralhealth/code-your-own-blockchain-mining-algorithm-in-go-82c6a71aba1f
PoS: https://medium.com/@mycoralhealth/code-your-own-proof-of-stake-blockchain-in-go-610cd99aa658

As we code, we ought to think of a positive incentive for validators to be honest in a chain designed for voting.
