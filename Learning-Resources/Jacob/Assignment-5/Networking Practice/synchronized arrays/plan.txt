Each node in the network acts as both server and client.  

1. Server 1 starts up and begins searching for Server 2
2. Server 2 starts up and begins searching for Server 1 
3. Server 1 finds Server 2 and Connects as a client, gets added to list of connected clients
4. Server 2 finds Server 1 and Connects as a client, gets added to list of connected clients
5. Client connects to and sends data to Server 1
6. Server 1 broadcasts data to list of connected clients
7. Both Server 1 and 2 have synchronized chains
